# Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform

OpenShift Container Platform from Red Hat is a foundational technology in this architecture. It combined with combined with F5s global server load balancing allows us the freedom to shift traffic seamlessly from DC to DC and Cloud to Cloud.

Much of the setup and configuration is taken from the documentation found on Red Hat's OpenShift Container Platform site and in thier GitHub repo. For this POC architecture we have chosen a simplified design that can be scaled depending on the needs of the customer.

The size of the clusters we will use are small so that a new user to OpenShift can kick the tires useing this architecture with a minimial investmet to do so. The good news is that the exact same implementation can we scaled up from this simple design with relative ease using the tools that we will eploy during initial setup and configuration.
