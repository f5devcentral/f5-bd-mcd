# Sample Applications Guide

Through the course of building this architecture we explored several applications that could be used to test this architecture. We had a few constraints tha were self imposed primarily to lend legitimacy to the purpose of the project.

The application must:
* Run in OpenShift or Kubernetes
* Utilize one or more preferably more micro-services
* Be off the shelf with no modifications

The following applications bubbled to the top as candidates. Any of these could be utilized as a testing application for this reference design. Each will offer their own relative level of complexity. We primarily used Red Hat Cool Store and Istio's Book Info. In this repo for simplicities sake we are only using one for now. You are more than welcome to use your own application choice however I do recommend starting with one of the ones below the easiest being National Parks or Bookinfo.
