# Ansible Playbook Set Up Guide

The Multi-Cloud playbook was fully functional a short while ago see the demo [OpenShift service mesh on multi-cloud environments](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Etglg2lrGo&t=0s&list=PLEGSLwUsxfEgT4XEohmRe_JB6MBnmLfBh&index=25). Currently we are working on a newer version of it to build in updated functionality, extended automation, and a more streamlined set of configurations.

I have uploaded a sanitized version of the original playbook for reference most advanced Ansible users will gain benefit from this visibility whilst I am working on the updated version.
