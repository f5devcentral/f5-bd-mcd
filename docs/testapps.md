# Setting up the Testing Application(s)

## Purpose
Two test applications have been provided. Book Info is a testing application that is published via the Istio project and a good example of a simplet multi microservice application.  Basic-App is a very simple php application that can be built right out of the repo using the pre-installed OpenShift templates.

These apps will be used to demonstrate how to publish and update an application using the previously mentioned A/B Deployment method.

## Notes
It is perfectly ok to deploy these applications to OpenShift at any time in the process prior to running the A/B Deployment automation task and leave them running.
